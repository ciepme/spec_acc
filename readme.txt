# README for Species Accumulation Curve Generator

This tool uses existing species abundance data to generate a fully permutated and averaged species accumulation curve. The tool assumes that the user has two data sets: upstream and downstream. Each column in the data indicates a sample and each row indicates a unique species.

New data should replace the existing .csv files in the project.

The program will output as text and will update the .png files to match the input data.

Start the program via spec_acc.mlx

There is an option to run without MATLAB via MATLAB Runtime, which is free and can be installed on MATLAB's website. Clicking the .exe file will start the runtime executable.
